# flightgear-F4U

This model is released under the terms of the GPLv2

This project is practice at using Blender, GIMP, Inkscape etc. to develop the skills 
needed to build detailed aircraft cockpits.

What this project is about is adding detail to the stock flightgear F4U-1 Corsair. I have tried to
remain true to the dash 1 as much as possible and excluded any models from other Corsair versions.


Keys:

c	toggle canopy

Ctrl-l	lock tailwheel

o	toggle Tailhook


See Aircraft Help in F4U-1 tab of F10 Menu


The Corsair has a working tailhook, the Logo and number
are customizable by the properties "/sim/model/corsair/front"
and "/sim/model/corsair/number". There are some examples in
the directory "/corsair/Models/logos". Guns are triggered by setting
/controls/armament/trigger" to "true". Guns are currently mapped to 
fire button on joystick.

Some of the objects are "borrowed" and modified under GPLv2. If I used your gizmo in this model, 
it was not because I wanted to profit from it. It was because I haven't learned how to create
gizmos as well as you do. Please take it as a compliment that I liked your model.

I hope you have as much fun flying it as I have had building it.

More mods to come....
